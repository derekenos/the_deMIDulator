;  * STICKYz *
;    + ISSUE: MIDI messages are not being serviced quickly enough, reduce adsr ISR processing load
;    -- not currently a problem but the following are opportunities for performance improvement
;    -- could push calling midiMessageMapper() to outside of ISR
;    + VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT OSCILLATOR STATE AND ADSR FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY
;    -- OSCILLATOR STATE CONTROLS activeOutputValues WHILE ADSR CONTROLS adsrLimiterRegs
;    -- Lack of synchronization will cause popping and noise
;    -- activeNoteTable is modified by ISR, so is VOLATILE!
;
;  * In Progress *
;    + Consolidating code for v1.00 release
;
;  * Pending *
;    + Figure out full port to PIC18LF14K22
;    + bootloader RX is not functioning properly.  LEDs indicate mode but often trasnsmission will not be received.
;      requires power-cycling unit then entering bootloader RX until it works.  No indication of any error, it just
;      doesn't indicate any activity. Seems ok when sending SysEx from USB-MIDI adapter
;    + Add MIDI channel select feature
;    + Improve MIDI servicing
;
;  * Waived Bugs / Issues *
;    + when enabling sustain mode with active notes in a wave mode (sine/square) and then switching
;      to sample, or vice versa, notes are not correct.  This is because sustained oscillators are
;      not currently updatable

;    !! GIT COMMIT 238b470191ea3c6d622c38e3fbbbcf705aca4d4f !!
;    + FEATURE: added partial support for PIC18LF14K22
;    -- basic MIDI / sound generation functions but buttons are disabled because INT0-2 are on completely different pins than PIC18LF13K50
;    --- from "http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39630g.pdf"
;    ---- "The 8-bit PIC microcontroller family is pin-compatible within a given pin count as well as code compatible between the architectures."
;    ----- bullshit
;    -- bootloader likely won't work either because 14K22 wants 16-byte write blocks and 13K50 expects 8-byte
;    + FIXED: holding 3 note chord in Sine mode and playing fast single notes with 4th oscillator, oscillator becomes unresponsive
;    -- observed that delegatedDeltas contained two copies of same delta value, realized that activeNoteTable is modified by ISR..
;       so is volatile and can change while the only mainline function to access activeNoteTable[], getActiveNoteDeltas(), is executing.
;    -- suspect that activeNoteTable[] update during getActiveNoteDeltas() execution was causing duplicate delta value in activeNoteDeltas[]
;    --- adding "soundGenFlags, activeNoteTableModified" flag (refreshActiveNoteState() sets it, getActiveNoteDeltas() clears it, tests it
;        once complete and re-executes if set) seems to have fixed it

;  * Changes *
;    !! GIT COMMIT 59ad9366b269c43afdc9c7dbfbc291c77d626526 !!
;    + REFACTOR: removed oscEnabledFlags since delegatedDelta check for == 0 serves same purpose
;    + BUG FIX: distortion in poly Sine mode, press two keys, release one, there's distortion in remaining note when first releases
;    -- fixed by removing oscEnabledFlags
;    -- speculate that oscEnableFlag was being cleared before delegated delta == 0 & even though osc was disabled, oscillator would still
;       spin every time delegatorBusy flag was set
;    + BUG FIX: certain Sine notes sustain for too long waiting for == PWM_IDLE_OUTPUT_VALUE. need to change to range
;    -- added activeOutputValue range check of (PWM_IDLE_OUTPUT_VALUE +/- OSC_TRANSITION_OUTPUT_THRESHOLD) to ungate osc changes
;    + BUG FIX: poly mode is significantly noisier than mono.  figure out why.  speculate it's the extra processing required
;    -- mono mode is now as noisy as poly. great job.
;    + BUG FIX: retriggering notes during release causes popping / hijacking oscillator (releasing or otherwise) causes popping
;    -- now conditionally "setf	PLUSW0, ACCESS" (FSR0 = adsrLimiterRegs) in oscAdsrTriggerAttack()
;    --- when releaseRate != 64, attack starts from whatever current adsrLimiterRegs happens to prevent sudden drop in output amplitude
;    --- when releaseRate == 64, adsrLimiterReg will be set to 0xff at attack
;    -- popping may still occur if attackTime == 0
;    -- acceptable solution for addressing other bug: "make reattack on note repress while releasing optional"
;    + REFACTOR: in serviceADSR(), ported OSC_ADVANCE_ADSR macro to dynamic code to save on Program Memory space
;    + FEATURE: attack/release disabled in mono mode
;    + FEATURE: Only retrigger sample on Note On
;    -- replaced "midiFlags, noteTransition" with "midiFlags, keyPressed". keyPressed flag is set unconditionally by activeNoteTableAdd()
;    -- audio sample recording now terminates only when new Note On is received
;    -- sample playback now only retriggers when new Note On is received

;  * Changes *
;    !! GIT COMMIT 1657b44278e19b6e4ef0 !!
;    + FIXED: added 'bcf STATUS, C, ACCESS' before 'rrcf' instructions where it had been missing
;    -- may fix infrequent pitch corruption bug
;    + FIXED: changed all 'rlncf' to 'bcf STATUS, C, ACCESS', 'rlcf'
;    -- '..ncf' does not work the way that I thought.  It rotates value instead of shifting in 0
;    + FIXED: reduced switch click at start of sample by adding 'recordWaitCountdown' variable
;    + FIXED: fix dc offset in monophonic mode. mono mode now mixes all oscillators just like poly
;    + FIXED: PRODH:PRODL registers are unprotected in functions eepromWrite64() and processSoundState()
;    -- now pushing/popping with softStack
;    + FIXED: ACCESS variables not correctly addressed as such or vice-versa
;    + FIXED: output popping on sample record termination
;    -- After last chunk, ISR sets sampleChunkReady flag and recordOrPlayback to PLAYBACK but...
;       mainline needed to poll eeprom for ready while the write completes before reading for playback…
;       otherwise EEPROM read will result in 0xff until write is complete and EEPROM becomes ready
;    + FIXED: fix sample mode dc offset / make compatible with new amplitude attentuation method (amplitude is totally screwed up)
;    -- Sample is now using identical mixing as Sine/Square
;    -- amplifying incoming sample data x2 to compensate for amplitude loss

;    !! GIT COMMIT e66886965d4cff794270 !!
;    + FIXED: distortion and clicking in adsr waveforms caused by dc-offset method of amplitude attenuation
;    -- attenuation now idles at value PWM_IDLE_OUTPUT_VALUE instead of 0

;  * Changes *
;    !! GIT COMMIT 5c73733e6b821f25c3c5 !!
;    + FIXED: Notes are hanging as result of failure to refresh, not dropped data
;    -- during note hang: activeNoteTable was empty but activeNoteDeltas WAS NOT EMPTY
;    -- problem was being caused by needRefresh flag being set in ISR during mainling execution of getActiveNoteDeltas
;    -- fixed by clearing flag immediately after checking in mainline and before call to getActiveNoteDeltas
;    + Deleted vestigal midiTerminalStringTables.inc from project
;    + FIXED: midiMessageMapper() entrance pushes FSR0 but exit pops FSR1. Seems to reduce stuck notes!
;    + FIXED: MIDI messages are not being serviced quickly enough, reduce adsr ISR processing load
;    -- appears fixed after correcting midiMessageMapper() FSR0/1 push/pop error
;
; DateCode: 20110819

;
;  * Changes *
;    !! GIT COMMIT 0db367c4d64ac051f9fe !!
;    + FIXED: lastApplicationProgramMemoryAddress is hardcoded into bootLoader at time of assembly so writes
;      would fail.  Fix was to hardcode lastApplicationProgramMemoryAddress to 0x17FE, just short of bootLoader start
;    !! GIT COMMIT e9907a0f7484f8fafa93 !!
;    + FIXED: scale MIDI attack and release controller values for better useful range
;    + FIXED: invert adsr value logic, MIDI controllers are called "Attack Time" and "Release Time"
;
;
; DateCode: 20110818
; Details:
;
;  * Changes *
;    + ADDED - adsr(-ds) function
;    + FIXED - second of two concurrent indentical notes now retrigger osc as first notes releases 
;    + FIXED - adsr breaks sustain, now ignoring sustaining oscillators in adsr advance macro
;    + WHO CARES - why is monophonic mode unaffected? set it to be permanently unaffected
;    + FIXED
;      - second of two concurrent indentical notes doesn't retrigger 2ND OSC!! as first notes releases
;      - adsr breaks polyphony (specifically, switching from delegator looking for 0x00 to looking for non-locked)
;      SOLUTION
;      - created spearate andLockedFlags variable and rename lockFlags to ddLockedFlags.  This fixed a lot of problems.
;        Was moronically using a single lockedFlags variable to flag currently assigned oscillators and activeNoteDeltas,
;        and recklessly just setting and reading flags from this single variable for two separate purposes
;

; DateCode: 20110817
; Details:
;
;   * Changes *
;     + changed modulation function
;     -- defined specific modulationBlendTable in "waveTables.inc" to make effect predictable
;     -- modulation value is no longer multiplied before offsetting table addresses,
;        making for a much smoother transition into effect
;     -- lower octave notes now sound amazingly fat
;     + changed audio output mixing scheme\
;     -- audio through is now /2
;     -- sine and square are now /8 before output, sample is /2 before output
;     -- sound balance is a bit better and now there's no volume drop for poly samples
;
; DateCode: > 20110128
; Details:
;         * Changes *
;
;         + Changed audio sample record to only function in SAMPLE mode
;         -- Info: Button still works for VOICE_THROUGH in SINE and SQUARE modes
;         + Cleaned up MIDI frontline rx routine
;         + Eliminated MIDI message buffering
;         + Fixed note delta corruption
;         -- Info: Timer2 ISR was corrupting TLBPTR & TABLAT
;         -- Info: Fixed by pushing TBLPTRL, TBLPTRH, TBLPTRU and TABLAT to soft stack at Timer2 ISR entrance
;         + Fixed dropped MIDI messages
;         -- Info: was failing to clear midiState_rxInProgress flag after processing received message
;         + Downgraded UART ISR to low priority
;         + Fixed sample record cancel on keypress that was broken by switching UART ISR to low priority
;         + Fixed bad sample recording
;         -- Info: issue appears to be related to using 'movff' instruction in EEPROM buffer write function
;         -- Info: fixed by not using 'movff'
;         + Added improved error checking to UART RX routine
;         + Cleaned up Timer2 sound generation ISR
;         + Cleaned up and consolidated EEPROM routines
;         + Fixed always soundOn & sample loop_forever mode
;         -- Info: needed to skip getActiveNoteDeltas during turnSoundOff condition
;         + Fixed bad note parity when switching between Sine/Square and Sample
;         -- Info: needed to refresh activeNoteDeltas when switching modes
;         -- added __DEBUG macro wait for SSPIF for EEPROM debugging
;         + Fixed sample playback c4 not same rate as record
;         -- Info: EEPROM write request transaction was taking way too long to happen in ISR
;         -- Info: was taking around 630uS to complete when ISR is supposed to re-enter every 63uS
;         -- Info: EEPROM write and read now happen in mainline code
;         -- Info: be aware that ISR is written to sampleDataBuffer as mainline is reading it and sending to EEPROM
;         -- Info: mainline is ahead of ISR though so there's no conflict
;         + Increased internal clock speed from 16Mhz to 32Mhz using 4x PLL & 8Mhz internal osc
;         + Added wavePrescaleCounter to divide wave plaback rate by 2. Timer2 does not have /2 config option
;         + Fixed MIDI Panic message processing. Now directly clears activeNoteTable[] and calls initSoundGen() for state reset
;         + Added Program Change controls waveform mode
;         + Replaced huge chunk of processSoundState playback code with single oscillator macros
;         -- Info: This has increased speed of processSoundState() to ~30uS in poly mode
;         -- Info: This also appears to have fixed hanging MIDI notes during keyboard mash. Yay for UART service time increases!
;         + Added polyphony for all waveShapes including Sample
;         + Changed Timer2 PR from 254 to 255 and replaced Delta tables
;         + Got rid of waveTableIndexes
;         + Got rid of useless version of output mixed code and their #defines
;         + in getActiveNoteDeltas(), encapsulated zeroDelta as critical
;         + Mostly fixed Sine/Square popping
;         -- Info: changed SQUARE wave table to start with 0x00 and end with 0xff
;         -- Info: changed mixer to always mix all four oscillators and /4, if SAMPLE then /2. This also balanced Poly volume
;         + Changed ADC clock to within acceptable TAD
;         + Panic now calls initMIDI() and initSoundGen()
;         + Simified LED routine.  Now all waveShape mods have 3 modeLevels, POLY/MONO/SUSTAIN
;         + Improved SAMPLE playback balance. If sample is loud then 4th osc will cause output to distort but this is ok
;         + Add Sustain as mode level 1. Monophonic moved to level 2.  Can use button or MIDI Sustain message to control
;         + Did some processSoundState() optimization to fix hanging MIDI notes
;         + Added modulation support for sine/square modes
;         + Made pitch wheel function more usable
;         + Modulation value >63 now reversed sample playback
;         + Sustain now locks pitch wheel and modulation values
;         + Pitch wheel down in sample mode cuts sample off and restarts on release
;         + Made waveform & mode change standalone functions that are called by button isrs
;         + Added conditional LED code for through hole PCB design and reverse polarity
;         + Prog Change and Sustain MIDI now calls waveform and mode change functions
;         + Forgot to add many updates to this file :(
;         + Resuming…
;         + 20110601: mootLoaderTx write program memory function now starts from offset USER_CODE_START_ADDRESS to avoid
;         -- corrupting jump to mootLoader on reset
;         + 20110601: mootLoaderRx now repeats all received bytes to MIDI out for device chaining
;
; DateCode: 20110128
; Details:
;         - First submit to GitHub
;         - Functioning Sine, Square and single Sample playback.
